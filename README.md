# Master-s-Research

In this research, we introduce a neural network method as a preliminary step towards our ultimate goal of identifying the parameters of complex structures, such as bio-molecules, under environmental conditions. 


By employing a simplified truss framework, we aim to explore the elastic responses of structures subjected to thermal environmental fluctuations. This method simplifies the complexities into models composed of rod elements and nodes, which experience deformation and movement due to thermal noise. 


The displacement of nodes, crucial for understanding the system's dynamics, is determined by the modulus of elasticity and the cross-sectional area (EA) of the rods. To estimate these varying EA values across the model, we utilize a fully connected neural network trained with simulated data, thereby enhancing our ability to predict the structure's behavior under various conditions. 


This technique offers a way of investigating the elastic characteristics of systems, providing valuable insights into their dynamic behavior without specifying their biological or molecular nature. The ultimate purpose of our work is to enable the recovery of material properties from experimental data, such as those obtained from cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) experiments, further bridging the gap between theoretical models and practical, observable phenomena.
